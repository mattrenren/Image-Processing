# Image-Processing
These codes applies image processing techniques such as:
Greyscale: converts RGB image to greyscale (black and white) by applying ratio of colours for each pixel.
Invert: converts supplied RGB or greyscale image to its opposite colours or in other words their complementary hues.
Blur: Blurs inputted image by finding the average of the pixel colours surrounding each pixel.
Sketch: converts the image to a sketch-like drawing by using a combination of greyscale, inversion and blurring.
ColourDifference: function used in TwoTone that calculates euclidean difference in colour between respective pixels in 2 m-by-n-by-3 arrays.
TwoTone: converts an image to use only 2 different colours. 
FindClosest: function used in Crystallise that given a pixel position, finds closest pixel from the given row and column co-ordinates.
Crystallise: applies a frosted window or mosaic-like filter to image.
